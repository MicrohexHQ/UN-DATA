Recently, she pioneered the World Wide Web Foundation's first gender data project [TechMousso](https://webfoundation.org/2016/07/techmousso-big-ideas-use-gender-data-to-improve-equality/), which brought together the data and tech communities with women's rights organizations to tackle gender challenges in CÃ´te d'Ivoire.

Her career has allowed her to work closely with many civil society organizations, the [African Development Bank](https://afdb.org/), the [Digital Solidarity Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_solidarity_fund) and has seen her involved in many phases of the [African Information Society Initiative](https://www.uneca.org/publications/african-information-society-initiative-aisi-decade%E2%80%99s-perspective).
