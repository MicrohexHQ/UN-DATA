# undataforum.github.io

This repository hosts the main UN Data Forum website, hosted at https://next.undataforum.org while under development.

## Development

This website is hosted as [organization page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Therefore, branches work a little different than in other repositories:

| Branch   | Default | Description                         |
| :------- | :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `gatsby` | yes     | Source code of Gatsby website.      |
| `master` | no      | Production build of Gatsby website. |
