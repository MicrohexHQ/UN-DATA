## Editorial guide

The United Nations World Data Forum website follows the [United Nations Editorial Manual](http://www.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/). This guide summarizes what you need to know when writing for the United Nations World Data Forum website.

### Spelling

Spelling follows the [Concise Oxford English Dictionary](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/concise-oxford-english-dictionary-9780199601080?cc=us&lang=en&), twelfth edition. In other words, use British English. There sre some notable exceptions, e.g., the United Nations writes _organization_ instead of _organisation_ and _specialize_ instead of _specialise_. You can lookup the spelling of commonly used words [here](http://www.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/spelling.htm).

### Acronyms

Use acronyms sparingly. Do not assume that all users are familiar with acronyms used by the data and statistical communities. These simple rules help make your writing easier to read and understand:

- Do not use acronyms in headings.
- Do not introduce an acronym when it occurs only once.
- Spell out an acronym when used for the first time outside a heading and put the acronym in brackets, e.g., write _geographic information system (GIS)_ on first use and _GIS_ subsequently.
- Establihsed acronyms can be used in headings and do not have to be spelled out.

#### Established acronyms

Here is a list of example of established acronyms:

- Specialized agencies of the United Nations system (such as UNDP, UNICEF, etc.),
- DESA,
- NGO/NGOs,
- IT (not ICT).

#### Academic titles

Use BA, BSc (not BS), MA, MSc (not MS to be consistent with BSc), and PhD. If you want to specify the field write, e.g., _BSc in sociology_. The field is not capitalized.

#### Exceptions

- Never write UN, always write United Nations.
- SDGs/SDG and NSOs/NSO are not considered established acronyms. They need to be spelled out in headings and on first occurence outside headings.

### Captialization

In headings, capitalize the first word only. The only exception to this rule are terms that should always be capitalized, such as _Sustainable Development Goals_.

Any other capitalizations should be used sparingly. Certain terms are capitalized when used in a specialized or restricted sense, the purpose of the capital being to point to the specialized or restricted sense.

#### Examples

- _Sustainable Development Goals_, _Sustainable Development Goal 13_ (or _Goal 13_) are always capitalized.
- _National Statistical Offices_, but _national statistical systems_ and _official statistics_.
- The following terms are never capitalized _big data_, _geographic information systems_, _voluntary national reviews_, and _development agenda_.

You can find more examples [here](http://www.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/capitalization.htm).

### Special entities

Always write _United Nations World Data Forum_. Do not use

- _UN World Data Forum_,
- _World Data Forum_,
- _Data Forum_,
- _Forum_, or
- _UNWDF_.

To refer to a specific year, write _2018 United Nations World Data Forum_.

Always write _United Nations Statistical Commission_. Do not use

- _UN Statistical Commission_,
- _Statistical Commission_,
- _Commission_,
- _UNSC_, or
- _Statcom_.

Always write _United Nations Statistics Division_. Do not use

- _UN Statistics Division_,
- _Statistics Division_, or
- _UNSD_.

### Special terms

- Write _2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development_ on first occurrence and _2030 Agenda_ subsequently. Never _Agenda 2030_.
- Write _Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data_ on first occurrence and _Cape Town Global Action Plan_ subsequently.
- The correct way of referring to "United Nations specialized agencies" is _specialized agencies of the United Nations system_ or short _specialized agencies_.

### Hypens and dashes

- Use hyphen `-` for compound terms, e.g., _eye-opener_.
- Use en-dash `–` for ranges, e.g., _2017–2019_, _Goals 3–9_, and _18–21 Oct 2020_.
- Use em-dash `—` with a space before and after to replace commas, parentheses and colons, e.g. _The conclusion — not guilty_.
