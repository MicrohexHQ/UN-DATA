## Editorial Guide

The United Nations World Data Forum website follows the [United Nations Editorial Manual](http://www.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/). This guide summarizes what you need to know when writing for the United Nations World Data Forum website.

### Acronyms

Use acronyms sparingly. Do not assume that all users are familiar with acronyms used by the data and statistical communities. These simple rules help make your writing easier to read and understand:

- Do not use acronyms in headings.
- Do not introduce an acronym when it occurs only once.
- Spell out an acronym when used for the first time and put the acronym in brackets, e.g., write _geographic information system (GIS)_ on first use and _GIS_ subsequently.
- Establihsed acronyms can be used in headings and do not have to be spelled out.

#### Established acronyms

Here is a list of example of established acronyms:

- United Nations agencies (such as UNDP, UNICEF, etc.),
- DESA,
- NGO/NGOs,
- academic titles (such as BA, MS, PhD, etc.)

#### Exceptions

- Never write UN, always write United Nations.
- SDGs/SDG is not considered established acronym. It needs to be spelled out in headings and on first occurence in text.

### Special entities

Always write _United Nations World Data Forum_. Do not use

- _UN World Data Forum_,
- _World Data Forum_,
- _Data Forum_,
- _Forum_, or
- _UNWDF_.

To refer to a specific year, write _2018 United Nations World Data Forum_.

Always write _United Nations Statistical Commission_. Do not use

- _UN Statistical Commission_,
- _Statistical Commission_,
- _Commission_,
- _UNSC_, or
- _Statcom_.

Always write _United Nations Statistics Division_. Do not use

- _UN Statistics Division_,
- _Statistics Division_, or
- _UNSD_.

### Captialization

In headings, capitalize the first word only. The only exception to this rule are terms that should always be capitalized, such as _Sustainable Development Goals_.

Any other capitalizations should be used sparingly. Certain terms are capitalized when used in a specialized or restricted sense, the purpose of the capital being to point to the specialized or restricted sense.

Here are some examples of capitalization or non-captalization

- _Sustainable Development Goals_, _Sustainable Development Goal 13_ (or _Goal 13_) are always capitalized.
- _2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development_ (on first occurrence) and _2030 Agenda_ on subsequent occurrences. Never _Agenda 2030_.
- - _National Statistical Offices_, but _national statistical systems_ and _official statistics_.
- Examples of terms that are never capitalized: _geographic information systems_, _voluntary national reviews_, and _development agenda_.
- Examples of terms that are always capitalized: _Cape Town Action Plan_, _Inclusive Data Charter_.
