## Innovations and synergies across data ecosystems

### Focus

Bringing data sources together and creating an enabling environment for the integration and use of non-traditional data sources.

### Description

Thematic area 2 addresses innovations and synergies across different data communities by creating an enabling environment for the integration and use of new and traditional sources of data. Sessions in this thematic area will explore

- how to champion the changing role of National Statistical Offices (NSOs) as they move from data producers to service providers;
- how to nurture collaboration between NSOs and non-traditional producers of data;
- how to integrate geospatial information and statistics; and
- how to leverage opportunities and mitigate risks associated with use of big data and other new data sources.

Sessions can also address data-driven algorithms for improved service delivery, uses of machine learning and predictive technology.
